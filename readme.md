The linking license is a permissive license with just one requirement:

**You must give the original author credit in the form of a link back to the original source.**

### How can i use the linking license?

Create a file called LICENSE.md/COPYING.md in your project root. Then add the following text to the file:

```markdown
<div align="center">
    <h1>LINKING LICENSE</h1> 
</div>

Copyright (c) <Year> <Author>

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to modify, copy, remix and redistribute the work as long as the following conditions are met:

You must give the original author credit in the form of a link back to the original source. License modifications (eg, changing the projects licensing) does not exempt you from this requirement.
